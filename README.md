# Object Pool Design Pattern
This repo is an example to demonstrate how the Object Pool Design Pattern works.

### Brief

A **creational** design pattern.

> Reusing the object that are expensive or slow to instantiate.
The pool is a container which contains a specified amount of objects. When an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back. Objects in the pool have a lifecycle: creation, validation and destroy.

### Participants

- Pool: The most important class. It works as a controller to handle clients' requests for reusable objects.
- Objects: The reusable objects that are expensive or slow to instantiate.
- Client: The class that requests to use object(s) in the pool.
